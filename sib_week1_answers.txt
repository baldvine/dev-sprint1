What is a route, and how do you specify one in Flask?
    Links a URL with a function. @app.route("/") etc

What is the only route we’ve specified in our application?
    @app.route("/") etc
What is the method that gets called when we hit that route?
    app.run()
If I wanted to add a route at “/world” that printed “Hello, World” on the screen, what would that code look like?
    @app.route("/hello")
    def hello():
        return "Hello World!"
If I create a new application and import testingflask.py (a.k.a. I am not running it directly), will code under the ‘if __name__ == “__main__”: be executed? Why not?
   No, because it will not be called from __main__ but from another frame.

Koch curve works! :)

*** Cut and paste the for loop here ***
                	{% for message in messages %}
{{message}}
                    {% endfor %}


*** What is the for loop doing? ***
Running through all the messages that have been stored and showing them
